<h2>Making DeskLib</h2>

<p><strong>Note: much of the following information is out of date. Hopefully
it will be updated with the next release of DeskLib.</strong></p>

<p>The default setup is for Norcroft.  If you have GCC, the things you
need to uncomment in the Makefile should be obvious.</p>

<p>We've changed the build system substantially from the previous 2.30 release,
partly so we can in future cross compile DeskLib, and partly to remove
the need for slightly unstable tools that we didn't have source for.</p>

<p>DeskLib requires GNU make - AMU isn't quite up to the job.  If you don't
already have GCC, then you can get this as part of the &quot;utils&quot; archive
from the <a href="http://gccsdk.riscos.info/">latest GCC release</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the system will build with tools from Castle's 32-bit release.
Don't try and rebuild DeskLib with a 26-bit compiler - you'll just end up
with a broken library. GCC should be able to build it fine too. Again, you'll
require a 32-bit version of GCC.</p>

<p>In general, using libraries such as DeskLib between UnixLib and
SharedCLibrary programs isn't a good idea, as they have some
incompatibilities.  DeskLib has been checked to ensure that it is
compatible with both C libraries.  Visit http://www.riscos.info/unixlib/
if you wish to know more.</p>

<p>Just running &quot;make&quot; is sufficient to build everything.</p>
