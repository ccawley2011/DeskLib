This application contains everything you need to write programs using
functions from the DeskLib library - the library itself, plus the
DeskLib header (.h) files. 

Once the filer has 'seen' this application, everything is set up ready
for you to use it.

To see the header files, simply double-click the application - a filer
window will appear in a convenient position at the right of the screen,
containing all the header files (if you don't like the layout, it can
be changed by editing the !Run file [hint: *help filer_opendir])

To #include the header files in your own code, use the form:
  #include "DeskLib:Header.h"

To link with the DeskLib library, use something like:
  link $(linkflags) C:o.Stubs DeskLib:o.DeskLib

For examples of this, look in the Examples directory.

About This Version
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This is version 2.80 of DeskLib.

It is designed for use with Castle's 32-bit C/C++ tools, or GCC 3.x version.
This is the *last* version of DeskLib that is suitable for use with these
compilers.  DeskLib version 3 onwards will require use of GCC 4 version
for RISC OS.

DeskLib is suitable for all RISC OS 3.x, 4.x and 5 machines.

DeskLib's homepage is http://www.riscos.info/index.php/DeskLib/

DeskLib StrongHelp
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The file '!DeskLib.Help' is a StrongHelp help-directory. This has been
automatically generated from the DeskLib header files. The formatting is
rather crude in places, but there is a help page for every DeskLib
function, typedef and global variable mentioned in the header files.
This file may lag behind the current implementation.
