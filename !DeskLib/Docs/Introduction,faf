<h3>About DeskLib</h3>

<p>DeskLib is a high-level library for use in the construction of C WIMP applications for RISC OS. It is designed to work with the Castle C/C++ tools or GCC 4.x. The code in the library is designed to work on any version of RISC OS from 3.x onwards. By providing convenient functions to automate some of the routine tasks associated with a standard WIMP program, it enables the programmer to spend more time on the core functionality of their program and less on the finer details of interacting with the WIMP. By providing standard functions, it also helps to prevent the need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; for common tasks.</p>

<p>DeskLib was originally written as a compliment (or alternative) to Acorn's RISC OS Lib and you can read more about the original motivations of the writers of large chunks of the library <a href="OldIntro">here</a>. It is now hosted on <a href="http://www.riscos.info/index.php/DeskLib">riscos.info</a>.

<p>DeskLib is split into functional &quot;Modules&quot; (which have nothing to do with <em>Relocatable Modules</em>) which provide set of functions to perform different sets of tasks. Over time, different contributors have written different implimentations of specific modules, so some are duplicated (e.g. Font and Font2). Generally the duplicate modules will do the same jobs in slightly different ways, so pick the one which suits you. Often, the later modules (e.g. Font<strong>2</strong>) provide a more sophisticated interface - but at the cost of increased complexity.</p>

<p>The DeskLib functions, types and variables follow a consistent naming style, which should become apparent quite quickly. For more details, see the <a href="file://<DeskLib_Sources$Dir>/Docs/Introduction">source documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The sources for the library are freely available, either via SVN access at <a href="http://www.riscos.info/index.php/Source_repositories_overview#DeskLib">riscos.info</a> or as a <a href="http://www.riscos.info/downloads/">complete archive</a>. You're welcome to alter and improve any part of the library, and even more welcome to send in your alterations so others can benefit.</p>
