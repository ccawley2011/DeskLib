    Version: 1.02 (17 Apr 2005)
             1.03 (25 Oct 2007)
    Purpose: Wimp version of ANSI assert() system, based on RISCOS_Lib
             version presented in Archive magazine 6.12.53 by Remo Biagioni.

*/


/* Abstract */
/*
  This implements a version of the standard assert() system, which reports
  any problem using a standard Wimp error window.

  This allows you to ensure certain conditions are met during development
  and then recompile without them for the final release.  To use assertions,
  compile your program with _DEBUG defined (ie. passing -D_DEBUG to the
  compiler).  To build the release version, simply ensure this is not defined.
*/

/*
  Example:

  If you have a function that expects a parameter which must be positive
  then it should include a line like:
    assert(parameter >= 0);

  If 'parameter' is not >= 0 then a wimp error box will report the fact,
  indicating where in your source the assertion failed.

  Macro: void assert(int expression);

  You simply call this with an expression you assert to be true, ie. it
  should evaluate to non-zero.  If the expression evaluates to be true
  nothing happens, otherwise it raises a Wimp error saying what the
  assertion was and where the assertion was made.
