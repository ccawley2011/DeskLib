    Purpose: Handles windows with panes.
*/


/* Abstract */
/*
  The functions declared in this header are intended to make handling panes
  relatively easy.  It works by allowing you to attach a pane to to a
  "master window".  You can then refer to the linked pair by the handle of
  that master window.

  It attaches panes relative to the top-left corner of the visible area of
  the window - if you want to attach to the bottom edge of a resizable window,
  you will have to update the offsets yourself as the window is resized, or
  else alter the Pane code to attach to the bottom edge instead of the top.

  The default offset between the windows, and the default size of the pane
  are read from the template file.

  This holds information about a 'master' window and its associated pane.
  It is set up by Pane_Link or Pane_CreateAndLink.  The offset is the offset
  of the top-left of the visible area of the pane from the top-left of the
  visible area of the window.  If you want to keep a pane attached to the
  bottom of a resizable window you will have to alter this offset whenever
  the window is resized.

  This 'isopen' flag is set when the pane pair is currently displaying.  The
  'fixed' flag means that the pane keeps the same position relative to the
  master window.  If you set 'resize', then the pane will be shrunk if the
  window is smaller than the maximum pane size, as the main window is resized.
  You decide how the pane should shrink by setting 'horiz' or 'vert'.  'horiz'
  means that the pane is horizontal, and should be shrunk to the width of the
  main window.  'vert' means that the pane is vertical and should be shrunk
  to the height of the main window.
