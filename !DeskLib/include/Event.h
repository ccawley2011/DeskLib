    Version: 1.02 (17 Apr 2005)
    Purpose: High-level WIMP event dispatch to a hierarchy of user event
             handling functions.
    Mods:    14 July 1993 - Added Event_Initialise3
             20 Mar 1995  - JPS Added veneers for global vars for use with DLLs
             1 May 2007 - Tweaked documentation

/* Abstract */
/*
  Event supplies a set of high-level function for proper handling of Wimp
  events.

  It polls the Wimp for you, and then passes the resulting event to one
  or more of your handler routines based on the event which occurred and the
  window and icon the event occurred in.  Events are cascaded down through
  your handlers until one of them returns TRUE, indicating that it has been
  dealt with succesfully.  This allows you to have application-wide
  defaults for certain event types, with occasional overrides of that
  default for specific windows or icons.

  Any event which has no handlers attached is automatically masked out in
  subsequent Wimp_Polls (except for quit messages).  A set of default (and
  example) handlers for some events is provided in the Handlers library.
*/

/*
  This type is for functions which can be used to process events claimed using

  to it, or FALSE to let it "fall through" for any other handlers to try and

  'handler' is your handler function, and 'reference' is passed directly to
  your handler function and can be anything you like.

  You can only attach events to a specific icon if you also specify a window.

  The more-specific events are called first, so you can have a general routine
  handling all icon clicks, and then several ones for specific icons which will
  be called first if those icons are clicked.  If two events are of identical
  priority (ie. you attach the same event to the same window and icon), the
  one most recently attached will be called first.

  Note that Null reason events are not enabled unless you specifically ask for

  for event_ANY.
