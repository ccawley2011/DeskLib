             and sundry contributors
    Version: 0.29 (02 Sep 1995)
    Purpose: Sprite-SWI interfaces.
             This version of the Sprite library only includes the most common
             sprite operations, and only on "user" sprite areas, and "named"
             sprites. (i.e. not pointers-to-sprites)
             More Sprite operations may appear as the moderator gets time
             to include them into the library.

    Mods:    02 Sep 1995 JH Sprite_MemorySize now works in 'double pixel'
                            modes (see 'Libraries.Sprite.c.MemSize' for the
                            details).
                            Added Sprite_Select.
