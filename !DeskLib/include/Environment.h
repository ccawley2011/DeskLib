/* Abstract */
/*
   This module provides functions to analyse and interact with the desktop
   environment, including logging, manipulating system variables and examining
   the active desktop processes.

   Most of the functions are self contained. For logging messages just use the
   Environment_LogMessage function. (See function descriptions for other
   functions.)

   You can set the log level to any number from 0 to 255. To quote the

   "Day-to-day information should probably be logged at around level 100.
    Certainly avoid levels of less than around 50 for non-critical messages.
    Level 10 means that the message is of similar importance to "Government
    declares war". Level 0 is of similar importance to "Armageddon imminent."
    Level 255 is of similar importance to "Water detected in ocean". The
    logging output of your program is much more useful if prorities are
    used well."

   the Environment_TaskListFree function.

   This function returns information about other tasks. Pass the name of the

   provided in log_LEVEL to get you started.

   This function uses the name passed to Event_Initialise for the log name
   (truncated to ten characters). If you wish to use a different name or
   use the function before you've called Event_Initialise, you should call
   Environment_LogInitialise first. If you want to specify the log name

   This function is called automatically to set the log name to be the first ten

   has not been called then "DeskLibLog" is used.)

   You should only call this function explicitly if you wish to override this
   default behaviour. The name is updated every time this function is called.

   This function also tests for the presence of the SysLog module. If it exists
   it returns TRUE, if it doesn't it returns FALSE and subsequent log calls will
   return an error.

   an update is required and if no existing system variable matches the
   expression, an error will be returned. Only the first system variable
   which matches the expression will be set.

   The value for the system variable is passed in 'value'. The
