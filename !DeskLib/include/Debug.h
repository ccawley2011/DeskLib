    File:    Debug.h
    Author:  Copyright © 1995 Julian Smith, Cy Booker, Paul Field.
    Version: 1.02 (17 Apr 2005)
    Purpose: Defines interface to a set of functions useful for
             debugging.
    Mods:    25 Aug 1995 - JS - Added Debug_Assert.

*/

/* Abstract */
/*
  This file has prototypes for a standard set of simple debugging functions.

  Several different ways of outputting debug messages are provided. Call
  Debug_Initialise to specify which method to use (otherwise the library
  defaults to outputting to stderr).

  This header file ensures that all calls to Debug_xxx functions are
  macro-ed out by the preprocessor unless DeskLib_DEBUG is predefined.
  So don't worry about debug calls taking up space in your finished
  project, they will disappear when you build a normal version of your
  project.

   This enum is used to specify which method of outputting debug
   information you'd like the debug functions to use. Pass one of
   the values to Debug_Initialise.

   REPORTER will output to Martin Avison's reporter, if it's present
   when the debug library is initialised (otherwise it will default
   to stderr).
   PIPETYPE writes to a file in Pipe: and displays it in a taskwindow
   on screen
   STDERR writes to the stderr output (usually specified by redirection
   in your !Run file).
   UNIQUEFILE writes to a unique file inside Scrap
   UNIQUEPIPE is similar to PIPETYPE but uses a unique file in Pipe:
   UNINITIALISED is only for use internally.
