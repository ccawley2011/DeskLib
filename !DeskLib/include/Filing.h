    File:    Filing.h
    Author:  Copyright © 1994, 1995 Sergio Monesi
    Version: 1.04 (27 Aug 1995)
    Purpose: Easy access to files informations, directory scans, filenames
             handling.
    Mods:    06 Jun 1995 - changed some procedure names to a more
                           DeskLib-compliant style
             15 Jul 1995 - added Filing_CanonicalisePath
             27 Aug 1995 - made Filing_ScanDir and Filing_ScanDirByDir
                           reentrant. Added Filing_SingleDirEntry and
                           Filing_SingleDirEntry2

/* Abstract */
/*
  This header defines functions to give easier access to file information,
  different ways to scan directory contents, and a couple of helpful
  filename handling routines.
*/


#ifndef filing_MAXLEAFNAMELEN
  #define filing_MAXLEAFNAMELEN 32
  /*
    Defines the maximum length of a leafname that can be stored in a
    filing_direntry or filing_fulldirentry structure.

    At the time the library was written, leafnames were generally limited
    to 10 characters, and 32 seemed (and in most cases still seems) a
    reasonable limit.

    As this value isn't used in the compiled library, you can #define it
    to whatever you want before including this header to set the value
    yourself.

    As far as I can tell, if it is too small for a filename you may simply
    not be able to read information about a file, as it will not fit
    into the buffer you supply.
