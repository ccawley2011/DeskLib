/* Abstract */

  of windows.  A number of them depend on you having used the Template library
  to load your templates, for example Window_Create.

  These are various opening positions for use with Window_Show and

  open_WHEREVER opens it in its last known position, or where it was defined
  in the template file.  open_OVERCARET opens it over the current caret
  position; if there is no caret it is opened centrally on the screen.
  open_UNDERPOINTER opens it so that the pointer is in the top left of the
  window if possible,  open_NEARLAST opens it slightly offset from the top
  left of the last window opened with Window_Show.

  could not be found.

  template could not be found.

  'maxtitlesize' should be the maximum length (in bytes) that will be needed

  the memory deallocation system.  It should only be deleted with

  This opens the given window on screen in the desired position.  This

  functions.  You should pass one of the values of the enumerated type
  window_openpos to specify the opening position.

  removes any Event handlers attached to the window.  If the window was
  created with Window_Create, it also frees any memory used by the window.

  this function and not Window_Delete

extern void Window_GetInfo(window_handle window, window_info *result);

  This is simply a frontend to the Wimp_GetWindowInfo call. However, it
  returns the Window info block *without* the icon definitions.
  Thus, you can use a window_info structure in your local variables without
  having to allocate enough memory to cope with any icons that the window
  happens to have in it. This is the old, slow, nasty RISC OS 2 compatible
  version of this function. See Window_GetInfo3 (below) for RISC OS 3
  specialness.

  having to allocate enough memory to cope with any icons that the window
  happens to have in it.

  This version is a smaller, tidier, faster version of the GetInfo call
  which makes use of a new feature of the SWI, available only under RISC OS 3
*/


extern void Window_ParentName(window_handle window, char *windowname);
/*
  This takes the handle of a window created with Window_Create, and
  attempts to find the name (8 characters only, truncated if necessary)
  of the template from which it was created.  If the window handle given
  is a negative number, "iconbar" is returned.
*/


extern BOOL Window_AutoHelp(window_handle win, icon_handle icon);
/*
  This adds a handler with the Event system for the given window and icon
  (event_ANY and window_ICONBAR may be used).  Thereafter, every
  HelpRequest message received for the window will be answered with a
  message from the list of messages loaded with Msgs_LoadFile, if one can
  be found.  Note that you will have to ensure that your task receives
  the help requests yourself, as it will be handled through Event and not
  EventMsg.

  The token for the message is constructed with the window's template name
  as the group part and the icon number as the tag part, ie. "window.icon".
  Any part of the window not covered by an icon is covered by a message
  with icon number -1 (eg. "mainwind.-1").  You can also use a message for
  anything not specified individually by using '*' (eg. "mainwind.*").

  All this function does is:
  Event_Claim(event_USERMESSAGERECORDED, win, icon, Window_HelpHandler, NULL);

  An alternative (using EventMsg instead):
  EventMsg_Claim(message_HELPREQUEST, win, Window_HelpHandler, NULL);
*/


extern BOOL Window_HelpHandler(event_pollblock *event, void *reference);
/*
  This is an event handler which provides help on windows and their icons,
  by finding a message from the list loaded by Msgs_LoadFile.  See
  Window_AutoHelp for details of the format for the messages.

  You can use this in combination with a custom help handler by checking
  if the pointer is in a place you want to give customised help about
  (eg. something depending on the file being displayed) and then calling
  this function for all other areas.  Another way is to register this
  function first, and then register a custom handler so that your other
  function gets called first, and this one automatically gets called if
  that one returns FALSE.

  This handler returns TRUE if it finds and sends a help message and FALSE
  otherwise.
*/


extern void Window_ModeChange(void);
/*
  This function will go through all of your templates and the windows
  created with them, and re-find the outline fonts used in them.  This
  should be done after a mode change to keep the fonts up to date, and
  the Handler_ModeChange function is provided to do this for you if you
  wish.  Fonts in window titles are not dealt with, as this would require
  recreating the window, among other things.

  Note that you can only call this function if *all* of your windows with
  outline fonts were created with Window_Create.  Otherwise it will
  release the font, not knowing that another window is still using it,
  which is almost certain to cause problems for your application.
*/


extern void Window_SetTitle(window_handle window, const char *title);
/*
  This changes the title in the given window to that pointed to by 'title'.
  If the title is not indirected the text cannot be changed, but no error is
  generated.  If the string is too long to fit, it is truncated to just
  fit in the available space.

  After setting the text, it redraws the area of the screen corresponding to
  the titlebar (if the window is open).
*/

/*
  This brings the given window to the front of the window stack, opening
  it if necessary.

/*
  This sets the window's work area extent.  If the window is open on
  screen, Wimp_OpenWindow will be called to make sure the change is
  reflected on the screen.

extern void Window_ForceRedraw(window_handle wh,
                               int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1);
/*
  This marks an area of the screen to be redrawn by the Wimp.  The screen
  area redrawn corresponds to the given rectangle of the given window's
  workarea, with (x0, y0) being the top left corner.

  This is essentially just a veneer for Wimp_ForceRedraw.
*/


extern void Window_GetCoords(window_handle wh, convert_block *coords);
/*
  This fills 'coords' with the coordinates for the given window.
  You use this function to read a convert block for use with the
  Coord library, for instance the Coord_WindowOrigin function.
*/


extern os_error *Window_GainCaret(window_handle window);
/*
  The gives the specified window the input focus, putting the caret in the
  first writable, non-shaded icon in the window,  If you pass zero as the
  window, the window currently with the input focus loses it.  If the
  given window already has the input focus, nothing happens.
*/


extern os_error *Window_ForceWholeRedraw(window_handle window);
/*
  This forces the redraw of the screen area corresponding to the given
  window.
*/


extern BOOL Window_MoveWindow(event_pollblock *event, void *reference);
/*
  This is a handler function to allow you to move a window by dragging
  any (or all) of its icons.  You can either register this function to
  be called when the given icon or window is clicked on, or else call
  it yourself (passing the parameters you received) from your handler
  for the icons that you want to work like the title bar.

  The icon button type should be iconbtype_CLICK (3); if you want the
  window background to be used as well, this should be set to the same
  button type.

  This function *always* returns TRUE.
