    File:    Pane2.h
    Author:  Copyright © 1995 Andrew Sellors.
    Version: 1.04 (4th August 1995)
    Purpose: Handles windows with panes.
    Mods:    1.02 -> 1.04
             Added pane2_MAINRIGHT, Pane2_GetMainHandle, Pane2_GetPaneNumber,
             Pane2_OpenWindow, Pane2_ReadVars, Pane2_SetVars.
*/


/* Abstract */
/*
  This aims to be a more flexible pane-handling library than that supplied
  by Pane, allowing multiple panes attached to one window, and allowing more
  options as to how the positions and sizes of the panes are calculated
  relative to the main window.
