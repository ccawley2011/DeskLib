/* Abstract */
/*
  EventMsg is an add-on for the Event system, which provides a layer of
  handlers to handle user messages (reason codes 17-19).

  To use these, you have to call Event_Initialise or an equivalent first.
*/

extern void EventMsg_Initialise(void);
/*
  Initialises the EventMsg system ready for use. Attaches EventMsg event
  handlers to catch all incoming Wimp messages (events 17-19).

  You no longer need to call this function. EventMsg_Claim automatically
  calls EventMsg_Initialise.  This is to support some library functions
  that call EventMsg_Claim when the user may not be aware, and in case
  the programmer forgets for his own code.

/*
  Much like Event_Claim, but for messages.

  Pass this the type of message (message action) you want to register a
  handler for, the window for which this applies (where appropriate) and
  the handler function to attach.  'messagetype' or 'window' can by
  event_ANY to be called for any message or any window.  'reference' will
  be passed to your handler - it can be anything you want.

  Priorities work like Event_Claim - specific window handlers have
  priority over all-window ones.

  This will call Wimp_AddMessages for any message codes you claim, so that
  your task can be sure of receiving the messages you claim whether you
  ask for them when you initialise the Event library or not.
