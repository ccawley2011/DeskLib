        Help for !DeskLib (Desklib compile-time resources)
        ˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This application contains everything you need to write programs using
functions from the DeskLib library - the library itself, plus the
DeskLib header (.h) files. 

Once the filer has 'seen' this application, everything is set up ready
for you to use it.

To see the header files, simply double-click the application - a filer
window will appear in a convenient position at the right of the screen,
containing all the header files (if you don't like the layout, it can
be changed by editing the !Run file [hint: *help filer_opendir])

To #include the header files in your own code, use the form:
  #include "DeskLib:Header.h"

(Note that there is a minor bug in Desktop C -  you will need to use 'cc
-I,C: ...' instead of 'cc -IC: ...' for this #include pathname to work.)

To link with the DeskLib library, use something like:
  link $(linkflags) C:o.Stubs DeskLib:o.DeskLib

For examples of this, look in the Examples directory.

DLL DeskLib
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This directory now contains a '!DLLs' application-directory with the
dynamically linkable versions of the DeskLib's sublibraries. You will
need to add them to the main Straylight !DLLs application using
!DLLMerge if you want to run programs which are built for use with the
DeskLib DLLs.

See the file !DLSources.SDLS_Apps for information on how to build an
application to use the dynamic linking version of DeskLib.


DeskLib StrongHelp
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The file '!DeskLib.Help' is a StrongHelp help-directory. This has been
automatically generated from the DeskLib header files. The formating is
rather crude in places, but there is a help page for every DeskLib
function, typedef and global variable mentioned in the header files.

Note that '!DeskLib.Help' needs StrongHelp version 2 to work - the old
StrongHelp uses a different format.



Version
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This is DeskLib version 2.30 .
