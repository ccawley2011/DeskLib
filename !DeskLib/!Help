        Help for !DeskLib (Desklib compile-time resources)

This application contains everything you need to write programs using
functions from the DeskLib library - the library itself, plus the
DeskLib header (.h) files. 

Once the filer has 'seen' this application, everything is set up ready
for you to use it.

To see the header files, simply double-click the application - a filer
window will appear in a convenient position at the right of the screen,
containing all the header files (if you don't like the layout, it can
be changed by editing the !Run file [hint: *help filer_opendir])

To #include the header files in your own code, use the form:
  #include "DeskLib:Header.h"

To link with the DeskLib library, use something like:
  link $(linkflags) C:o.Stubs DeskLib:o.DeskLib

For examples of this, look in the Examples directory.

About This Version
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This is version 2.50pre4 of DeskLib, the first release in rather a long time.
This version was brought about for several reasons, one was for a 32-bit
version DeskLib, another was the need for a reasonably popular Wimp
library to be brought up to date.  The latter is ongoing.

This version of DeskLib is 32-bit only.  This means that to use it, you
will require a 32-bit C Compiler, such as Castle's 32-bit C/C++ tools,
32-bit GCC or LCC.  The latter two have not yet been publically released.

If you wish to know more about RISC OS and 32-bit, then visit
http://www.riscos.info/32bit/

There is no intention to make a newer 26-bit only version of
DeskLib, as we would like to encourage developers to make all new
software (and software versions) 32-bit compatible.  If you really
require a 26-bit version, use version 2.30:

DeskLib is suitable for all RISC OS 3.x, 4.x and 5 machines.

Has been removed, as we consider this of very limited interest.


DeskLib StrongHelp
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The file '!DeskLib.Help' is a StrongHelp help-directory. This has been
automatically generated from the DeskLib header files. The formatting is
rather crude in places, but there is a help page for every DeskLib
function, typedef and global variable mentioned in the header files.
