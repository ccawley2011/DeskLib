<h1>DeskLib 2.60: 2nd December 2004</h1>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>DeskLib is a fully-sourced general-purpose freeware C library for writing desktop applications for RISC OS. The aim of DeskLib is to collect together useful little snippets of code to help the desktop programmer.</p>

<p>In this area, DeskLib already provides a full set of WIMP SWI veneers in assembler, a whole set of useful icon manipulation functions, etc. Higher-level event managers, etc. are also provided but trade off efficiency and compactness to provide genericity.</p>

<p>The completely installed DeskLib distribution looks something like:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>DeskLib.!Help</dt>
	<dd>This file.</dd>

	<dt>DeskLib.!DeskLib</dt>
	<dd>Header files, the main DeskLib library, documentation</dd>

	<dt>DeskLib.!DLSources</dt>
	<dd>All source code, makefiles, scripts, etc.</dd>

	<dt>DeskLib.!DLUser</dt>
	<dd>Directory for user's extra sub-libraries.</dd>

	<dt>DeskLib.Docs</dt>
	<dd>Documentation files.</dd>

	<dt>DeskLib.Examples</dt>
	<dd>Example applications.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you have used previous version(s) of DeskLib, please consult 'DeskLib.Docs.Updates' to see what has changed.</p>


<h2>(Re)compiling DeskLib</h2>

<p>See !DLSources.!Help for information about compiling/recompiling DeskLib, the layout of the sources, etc.</p>


<h2>DeskLib distribution information</h2>

<p>DeskLib is now rather large, so it has been split up to allow people to download just the parts they require.</p>

<p>The separate parts of DeskLib are in zip files.  Each of the zip files contains just those parts of the DeskLib directory structure needed to contain the zip file's particular selection of DeskLib's files. This allows you to simply extract the zip files into the same place to get the parts of the DeskLib tree that you require.</p>

<p>The 'Core' zipfile contains everything need to compile and link programs which use DeskLib (ie. the header files and library file !DeskLib.o.DeskLib), plus the documentation files and release notes.  This includes everything in !DeskLib, !DLUser and the 'Docs' subdirectory.</p>

<p>The 'Sources' zipfile contains all the source code for DeskLib (which is stored in !DLSources), plus makefiles and scripts needed to compile DeskLib.  This does not include any object files.</p>

<p>The 'Examples' zipfile contains a few example programs with source, plus some random source code.</p>

<p>The "StrongHelp" zipfile contains just the one file, which is a StrongHelp manual which documents the DeskLib library.  Note that this is just a nicely-formatted version of the h_doc files in the "Core" distribution, and also that the extracted file is quite large.</p>
