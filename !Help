DeskLib
-------

DeskLib is a set of fully sourced C libraries for for writing desktop
applications for Acorn RISC OS. The aim of DeskLib is to collect
together useful little snippets of code to help the desktop programmer. 
In this area, DeskLib already provides a full set of WIMP SWI veneers in
assembler, a whole set of useful icon manipulation functions, etc. 
Higher-level event managers, etc. are also provided but trade off
efficiency and compactness to provide genericity.


The completely installed DeskLib distribution looks something like:


DeskLib.!Help		This file.
DeskLib.!DeskLib...	Header files, the main DeskLib library,
			DeskLib's StrongHelp file, dynamic-linking
			libraries.
DeskLib.!DLSources...	All source code, makefiles, scripts, etc.
DeskLib.!DLUser...	Directory for user's extra sub-libraries.
DeskLib.Docs...		Documentation files.
DeskLib.Examples...	Example applications.

DeskLib distribution information
--------------------------------

DeskLib is now rather large, so it has been split up to allow people to
download just the parts they require.

The separate parts of DeskLib are in zip files in this directory. These
can be extracted using Spark.

Each of the Zip files contains just those parts of the DeskLib directory
structure needed to contain the zip file's particular selection of
DeskLib's files. This allows you to simply extract the zip files into
the same place to get the parts of the DeskLib tree that you require.

Here is which parts of the complete distribution each zip file in this
directory contains:
