!DLUser - user DeskLib libraries.
---------------------------------

This directory is for any DeskLib libraries that you write that aren't
(yet) part of the main DeskLib distribution. The !Boot file sets the
path 'DeskLib_User:' to point to the !DLUser directory.

DeskLib$Path is set in the main !DeskLib directory to be
'DeskLib_User:,DeskLib_Core:', so your header files are searched first
when '#include "DeskLib:xxx.h" is encountered in a .c file by the
compiler.

The intention behind this is that it makes it easier to have your own
DeskLib libraries, as you don't have to copy your headers into
'!DeskLib.h'. Installing a new DeskLib release is also easier, as there
shouldn't be any need to change the main !DeskLib application.

There is now a set of script files in '!DLUser.Scripts'. 'MakeAll' runs
the makefile in each sublibrary directory, and then makes a library
'!DLUser.o.DLUser' containing all of this code.

In '!DLUser.o.' is a library file for each sublibrary within '!DLUser',
plus a file '!DLUser.o.DLUser' which contains all these libraries in one
file. This is to allow you to link either with individual libraries or
all at once.

There are also two example libraries 'Hash' and 'Import' in this release
of DeskLib.
