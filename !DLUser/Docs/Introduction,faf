<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">!DLUser - User DeskLib Libraries</h2>

<p>This directory is for any DeskLib libraries that you write that aren't
(yet) part of the main DeskLib distribution. The !Boot file sets the
path 'DeskLib_User:' to point to the !DLUser directory.</p>

<p>DeskLib$Path is set in the main !DeskLib directory to be
'DeskLib_User:,DeskLib_Core:', so your header files are searched first
when '#include &quot;DeskLib:xxx.h&quot; is encountered in a .c file by the
compiler.</p>

<p>The intention behind this is that it makes it easier to have your own
DeskLib libraries, as you don't have to copy your headers into
'!DeskLib.h'. Installing a new DeskLib release is also easier, as there
shouldn't be any need to change the main !DeskLib application.</p>

<p>There is now a set of script files in '!DLUser.Scripts'. 'MakeAll' runs
the makefile in each sublibrary directory, and then makes a library
'!DLUser.o.DLUser' containing all of this code.</p>

<p>In '!DLUser.o.' is a library file for each sublibrary within '!DLUser',
plus a file '!DLUser.o.DLUser' which contains all these libraries in one
file. This is to allow you to link either with individual libraries or
all at once.</p>

<p>There are also two example libraries 'Hash' and 'Import' in this release
of DeskLib.</p>
