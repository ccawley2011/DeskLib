These files document all the extra notes for each module that have currently
been written.

Eventually, they will be combined with the information from the .h files to
form a proper manual, but for now they are organised in this fashion for
easier development and to encourage authors to note any interesting or
useful points in a file for each module they write, which helps end-users of
the library by pointing out things that the author might think are obvious
(because the designing author knows exactly what is going on in his/her
code) but which aren't.
