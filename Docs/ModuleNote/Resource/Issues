Resource_ChoicesInit()
======================

 * This generates a fatal error if the 'appname' parameter is null.

   It could alternatively extract the appname from the 'resource_pathname'
   global, in the event of a null 'appname' parameter.

   I think having the appname specifiable is important, for cases where
   the config utility may be separate from the main application, but this
   fallback approach could be useful.



Resource_ChoicesPath()
======================

 * I've allocated 256 chars for 'Choices$Write' and 'Choices:' sys vars.
   Is this enough ?  1024 ?


 * There are 2 blocks of similar code (setting up of pathname using
   Choices$Write) that could be moved out into a sub function.

   This would shorten the code, simplify its readability, and remove any
   chance of introducing disparity.


 * In the section that deals with an 'upgrade' (ie the new boot has
   recently been installed), I'm uncertain of the action to take in the
   case of an error when copying the old choices file to the new location.
