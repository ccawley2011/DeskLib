 About DeskLib
 =============

 After some bad experiences with Acorn's RISC OS Lib, I decided that a new,
 well written, professionally-finished library would be very useful. Acorn
 appeared to be uninterested in fixing RISC OS Lib for me, so I managed to
 rustle up a band of merry programmers to help me write a completely new
 library, from scratch, and design things before they were written.

 The result is (or will be ?!) DeskLib.

 DeskLib is a set of ANSI C and ARM assembler sources intended to add to or
 replace PARTS of the libraries supplied with Acorn Desktop C. Many parts of
 DeskLib replace parts of the Acorn Libraries, but many portions of the
 library code can be used in conjunction with Acorn's libraries, or as a base
 from which you will be able to more easily write code for use with Acorn's
 Libraries, so don't go away just yet!
 This library is intended both as an alternative to Acorn's RISC OS Lib as
 well as a useful source of fragments of code to include into your own
 sources.

 All efforts have been spent to make the library code as generic, robust,
 and useful as possible, as well as attempting to provide a comprehensive
 range of function calls, from basic SWI-level support to high-level
 functions such as automatic dialogue-box creation, handling and
 result-return in a single function.

 Where possible, routines have been optimised (to some extent) for
 efficiency, but the primary goals are high-level interfaces that make WIMP
 programming quick and easy. (If the user wants to specifically do something
 special, and wants it fast, the source code for DeskLib is available, so any
 functions can be adapted for the user's needs as necessary...)

 All possible action is taken to keep code size down without adversely
 affecting the functionality of the library: Individual functions are added
 to the library separately, so that including one function in your code
 does NOT include the (unwanted and unneeded) code for several others.

 Where possible, code is written as a standalone unit to avoid pulling in
 too much other DeskLib code when you include a function.

 Attempts have also been made to rationalise the naming conventions used,
 while keeping as much compatibility with the Acorn libraries as possible.
 Thus, data structures are as similar to acorn conventions as possible, but
 with occasional names altered to improve readability and/or consistency.
 We have reverted back to basing our naming on Acorn's very well designed
 SWI interfaces and their use, rather than sticking with Acorn's RISC OS Lib
 abstractions to keep this environment closer to its Assembler and BASIC
 cousins, which will make it easier to port programmers between environments.

 As a result, DeskLib has been developed by individual programmers working
 to some basic guidelines, with me, the moderator, taking in the code,
 tidying up any "loose ends" I find, and then including the final code in
 the Library. This has helped to keep everything as consistent as possible
 throughout the library. (Though I can't guarantee that the library is
 perfect, I believe it is far superior to RISC OS Lib in the areas it
 currently covers)

 The code has been written to provide a high-level interface that supports,
 encourages, and all BUT forces programmers to use a more consistent
 interface design.

 The programmer using DeskLib is encouraged to use our more generic template
 and menu routines, so that the END USER of the product has more control 
 of the look, feel, layout, and hotkeys used in the program.

 However, another important concept is that YOU are in charge, and DeskLib
 is just a tool for you to use, so it should not force you against your will
 if possible. Thus, we provide unrestricted low-level access as well. And by
 providing the sources, we make it possible for you to do low-level "tweaks"
 on our high-level data structures without the fear that you might be
 treading on the toes of some other code.

 We also feel it is important to distribute the library sources freely, so
 that you may improve or alter the library to suit your own needs, and
 hopefully send back any improvements or bug fixes to me so that they may be
 officially incorporated into the DeskLib distribution. Also, you can SEE
 what functions do, and thus KNOW what they do, and therefore be able to
 cope with what they do, rather than tripping over low-level implementation
 details/bugs that the author didn't bother to make you aware of.

 We have absolutely NO objection to including SEVERAL DIFFERENT code modules
 that do essentially the same thing, so that you may CHOOSE the one that
 suits you best.



Authors
 If code you have written is incorporated into this library, you still
 retain your copyright for it. However, if you wish to retract
 copy-permission for a part of DeskLib you have written, then it will be
 removed from *future* releases of the distribuion, and the retraction will
 not affect previous release versions of the library, or any software
 product that used them. Probably an equivalent bit of code will then be
 written by somebody else to fill the gap.

 If DeskLib is updated by someone writing code based upon your suggestions
 and/or code, then they retain copyright for that which they have written,
 though you will be credited in the updated file(s).

 If you write any FreeWare using the DeskLib libraries, it would be really
 nice of you to send me a copy of the sources and final application to
 possibly be included in future DeskLib releases as tutorial/demonstration
 code, or at least distribute your sources (or parts thereof) with your
 application so that they may serve as example code for others.

 For documentation on using DeskLib in your own programming projects, and
 submitting your own code/ideas for inclusion in DeskLib, please read the
 files in the Docs directory. Note that most of the documentation of
 function calls is provided in the form of comments in the relevant header
 (.h) files at present.

 The last point is that although we are trying to provide complete useful
 code, some bugs are bound to fall through the net... Some decisions on
 naming or data structures may seem bad to you (some do to me), but we
 have our reasons (usually consistency) for doing things this way.
 We are doing our best: Constructive criticism is welcome, but please
 don't winge at us - If you don't like something, then don't bother me - go
 away and spend a year writing the code yourself... I don't welcome
 criticism from people who are unwilling to write the code themselves.

 Now please go back and read the conditions that you skipped at the top of
 this file, because they are important ;-)

   Thanks also to the numerous others who have offered suggestions, etc.
   Thanks to Acorn for designing the machine and the compiler.
   And for RISC OS Lib??  I guess so, or this would never have appeared, and
   I would be forced to relax in the weekends ;-)
