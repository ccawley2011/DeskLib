!IncDec
by Lee Atkinson

This example application tests the Icon increment/decrement button handlers
These provide a simple way of adding a writable integer icon to your window,
with bump icons with which the value can be increased/decreased.

You will need to make this application before you can run it - inside the
application directory you will find the source, and a makefile.
