Help for !TestApp
=================

This small application is used both as a small test for DeskLib
and as a demonstration of some of the main facilities provided
by the library.

NOTE that it now tests the outline font handling code, and needs
the fonts Homerton and Trinity to be available in order to run.


Double click its icon to run it.

First, it will run the hourglass for 2 secondS as a test. (During this
time, the pointer will be restricted to a rectangle of the screen where
one of the test windows is going to appear shortly)

Three windows should appear (one will appear as it was defined in
the template file, one will be centered on screen, and the last
will appear under the mouse pointer.

These windows now use RISC OS 3.10 bordered icons, so you will only
get a '3d' look to them if you have RISC OS 3.10 or later. They should
also include several different styles of 2 outline fonts.
(To test the font handlers, try changing between lo-res and hi-res
screenmodes (e.g 9, 12, 20) - if the font stays the correct size,
everything is working as it should)

Clicking MENU over the iconbar icon or any window will pop up a demo
menu with the following items:
  Change Title - an item which beeps when clicked, with a dotted line
                 underneath. This will be shaded if you brought the menu up
                 over the iconbar. If you select it (when brought up over a
                 window) then the window's title text will be changed.
  Item 1       - a shaded item
  Item 2       - an item which produces an error box when clicked...
                 It also leads to a submenu:
    Indirected text   - an item with more than 12 characters in it
                        Click here with select or Adjust to tick it
    Short text        - another item which can be ticked instead.
    Extension 1      }- Two menu items which have been added to the menu
    Extension 2      }  to test "Menu_Extend()"
  Quit         - Click here to quit the application

The source code to create !TestApp with is contained inside the application.
The code is heavily commented to tell you everything it is doing, and is
pretty short & simple. It is a good place to look when starting to figure
out just how to use DeskLib.

Note that TestApp includes almost all of the DeskLib library, but has very
little functionality - it is thus extremely large for what it does! However,
when you start to add more functionality, the size usually comes out far more
reasonable! Of course, you do not need to include all of DeskLib's code in
your own applications - if you just stick to the SWI veneers, you will get
a very compact, fast application out of it.

There is now a version of TestApp that is compiled for use with the DLL
version of DeskLib. Because making a DLL-version involves a different
set of libraries from normal, there is a second makefile for this,
called '!TestApp.DLLMake'. All the .o files for the DLL version are in
'!TestApp.!DLL'. Double-click on this to make the DLL version.

Double-click on !TestApp.!RunDLL to run this version (you will need to
have the Straylight Dynamic Linking System installed for this to work).



A third version of !TestApp is now present - this has debugging enabled,
and the relevant files are in '!TestApp.!Debug'. This uses the standard
makefile, but calls it setting 'CCExtra' to be '-DDeskLib_DEBUG'. This
is put in the call to cc, so all DeskLib Debug_ calls are implemented.
Double-click on '!TestApp.!Debug' to build this version, and
double-click on '!TestApp.!RunDebug' to run it.
