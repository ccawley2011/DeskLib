#  Help message for the iconbar icon. Note that help gives a message
#  "iconbar.<icon_number>", where the icon number isn't known until 
#  runtime, so we use a wildcard to match any icon we own on the iconbar
#  - as we only usually have one icon, this isn't normally a problem.

iconbar.*: This is the <app.name> icon.|MIt has no purpose yet.


#  Help messages for all windows created from the "mainwindow" template.
#  Note how only the first 8 characters ("mainwind") can be used by the

#             background have their help (mainwind.*)
