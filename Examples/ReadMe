These are examples of code using DeskLib.  This directory should contain:
  - This ReadMe
  - Various example applications
  - The OtherSrc directory
  - The Widget5 directory

Example apps
------------
The example applications should compile with either Norcroft or GCC, though you will require GNU make to use the makefiles.  GNU make is included in the GCC distribution(s).

To make one of the examples, simply go into the application directory, set the wimpslot to at least 5000k and type "make".

e.g. for building with Norcroft (Castle/Acorn C/C++ package)
*wimpslot 5000k
*make

e.g. for building with GCC
*wimpslot 5000k
*make COMPILER=gcc

OtherSrc
--------
This holds various code snippets (not generally self-contained programs) which may be of interest or demonstrate use of some part of the DeskLib library.

Widget5
-------
This contains the source to an image processing program, for which there is no GCC makefile.  This is because you need bits of the old RISCOS_Lib, for which you will need to own a copy of the Norcroft tools anyway, and it is a lot of trouble to remove it at the moment. :)

It has its own ReadMe if you want more information about it.
