DLGenRelease
------------

This is a very simple package of command line utilities and a script, to
automate the process of creating the DeskLib help documentation and spit
out the release archives. Any contributions and improvements are
welcome.

As prerequisites for the script you'll need:
 * to have built the haddoc and haddoctosh binaries under RISC OS
   (you'll need RISC OS ports of pcre and libxml from
   http://www.riscos.info/downloads/unix-libraries/ then hopefully
   just typing "make" in the relevant directory should be sufficient)
 * to have built the main DeskLib binaries (see !Help in !DLSources)

and:
 * an active internet connection (to export from the svn repository)
 * the RISC OS svn port - http://www.cp15.org/versioncontrol/
 * the RISC OS zip port - http://www.sbellon.de/sw-ports.html
 * to not care that the CSD gets reset! ;)

The version number and svn download location are set at the top of !Run.

If everything goes to plan, you should end up with an open filer window
containing directories for release archives, RiscPkg archives and
documentation. There'll also be a XMLDocs file which is used during the
generation process and is not important if everything finishes OK.

The release archives are made up of svn exports of the DeskLib
repository together with your locally generated DeskLib library binary
and a StrongHelp quick reference.
